SelBlocks (for Selenium IDE) 2.0.1
by refactoror

Latest version 2.0.1

This is an extension for Selenium IDE that provides javascript-like conditionals, looping, callable functions, error catching, and JSON/XML driven parameterization.

================================================================================
About this Add-on

<strong>SelBlocks 2</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Adds the following control structures to Selenese:
    <ul>
    <blockquote><code>if</code>, <code>elseIf</code>, <code>else</code></blockquote>
    <blockquote><code>try</code>, <code>catch</code>, <code>finally</code>, <code>throw</code></blockquote>
    <blockquote><code>for</code>, <code>foreach</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>continue</code>, <code>break</code></blockquote>
    <blockquote><code>call</code>, <code>function</code>, <code>return</code></blockquote>
    <blockquote><code>loadJsonVars</code>, <code>loadXmlVars</code>, <code>forJson</code>, <code>forXml</code></blockquote>
    <blockquote><code>exitTest</code></blockquote>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Command parameters are javascript expressions that are evaluated with Selenium variables in scope, which can therefore be referenced by their simple names, e.g.: <code>i+1</code>
  </li>
  <li>Function and loop parameters use regular Selenium variables that are local to the block, overriding variables of the same name, and that are restored when the block exits.
  </li>
  <li>Errors bubble upward through try/catch/finally blocks, which can be nested arbitrarily. Catching an error cancels it, but can be re-thrown.
  </li>
  <li>Variables can be configured via external XML and/or JSON files.
  </li>
  <li>A function definition can appear anywhere, (they are skipped over in normal execution flow).
  </li>
  <li>Functions can be called recursively.
  </li>
</ul>

Note that it take months for Mozilla to review each addon update. For compatibility with Firefox versions above 17, see: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide-sel-blocks/versions/
